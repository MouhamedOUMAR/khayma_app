# MRT Image Instruction

## Image Placement
Please save the traditional kheyma/structure image you shared as:
```
public/images/hero/mrt.jpg
```

## Current Status
- Home page hero section updated to display `images/hero/mrt.jpg`
- Image file: **PENDING** - needs to be saved to the location above

## Steps to Complete
1. Save the image (the traditional kheyma structure with thatched roof) as `mrt.jpg`
2. Place it in `ma-vacance-mauritanie/public/images/hero/` folder
3. The home page will automatically display this beautiful kheyma image in the hero section

Once the image is placed, the home page (Accueil) will show the authentic Mauritanian kheyma structure instead of the placeholder icon.
